# Sitemap Generator via bash

Will generate a sitemap.xml file for the current directory and all it's subdirectires.

The options of find are located in _sitemap.sh.options_ - there you can deselect file types or directories.

## Webarchitects fork

This version differs from [the original](https://github.com/mcmilk/sitemap-generator) as it sets the `priority` for the key pages on the [Webarchitects](https://www.webarchitects.coop/) site and also omits the `.shtml` extensions from the filenames.

Plus it links to a copy of [sitemap xml stylesheet](https://github.com/catcto/sitemap-stylesheet).

The [code for the Webarchitects site](https://git.coop/webarch/website) is on [git.coop](https://git.coop/).
